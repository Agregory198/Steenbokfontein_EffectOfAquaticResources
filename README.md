# The effects of coastal resource use on hunter-gatherer technological strategies 4 ka
This project aims to evaluate the effect that increasing coastal resource use had on hunter-gatherer technological and social strategies at Steenbokfontein Cave in South Africa 4,000 years ago (4 ka). For the longest time, archaeologists have viewed aquatic resources like lakes, rivers, and coasts as last resort living. Archaeologists have historically used ethnographic data from Kalahari hunter-gatherers to drive their interpretations of resources that prehistoric hunter-gatherers would have targeted. However, prolonged periods of colonization have marginalized Kalahari communities. These marginalized communities have been living in a restricted environment, one that portrays hunter-gatherers as highly mobile groups living in a deprived environment that does not support aquatic resources. Not only is this view overly simplistic and false, but it does not capture the full spectrum of human behaviors in the prehistoric past. A broader view of ethnographic data from around the world shows a diverse spectrum of human behaviors when they have access to aquatic resources.

## Overview
This is a multivariate project that examines whether hunter-gatherer technologies changed when they transitioned from terrestrial to coastal-dominated diets at Steenbokfontein Cave. I use simple statistics of central tendency to descibe the average technological strategy at Steenbokfontein Cave. I use Bayesian models to evaluate the relationship of several stone tool variables including utility, length, and mass. I use gt_summary and ggplot2 to develop publishable tables and figures.
